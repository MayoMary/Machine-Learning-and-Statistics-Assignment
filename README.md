This jupyter notebook analyses the Boston House Prices dataset utilising scipy, keras and Python packages. 

### Describing the dataset
Boston House Prices is based on housing data held by the United States Census Service pertaining to the area around Boston, Massachuttes. Each data sample relates to a particular town and has specific information based on various measurements. 
The dataset was first published in 1978 by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. in the folowing article - `Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.

The dataset is made up of 506 rows for the following 14 variables:
CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
LSTAT - % lower status of the population
MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
